# XFCE4 Terminal config file

This is my color preferences for my XFCE4 Terminal, with a dark background and brilliant collors. Although not perfect, it has been working for now. I will make more changes as I go along...


## Installation

1. `cd` into your config dir

   ```
   $ cd ~/.config/Terminal/
   ```

2. Backup any old setting you want to keep
3. Copy the file over and merge the settings

   ```
   $ wget https://raw.github.com/marcelom/xfce4-terminalrc/master/terminalrc
   ```
